The files in this folder don't need to be deployed to MBI&R. The Portfolio Statement.rptdesign doesn't depend on them directly.

They are included as a reference, and should be used if it's required to update the data displayed in the crosstab on the second page of Portfolio Statement.rptdesign.

The data displayed on the first page of the report comes from "Static Data Sources", and can be updated by updating the corresponding datasets in Portfolio Statement.rptdesign
